Working (bugs)

    Physics Circle/Poly collision
      - Ordering is wrong so the normal is messed up.  Adding the rect prior to the circle
        works, vice versa does not.
    Player animations frames and collision boxes don't match up
      - It's working correctly, but the origin is wrong.
    Logger occasionally does not start

Working (enhancements)

    Assets:
      - Investigate removing shared_asset destrutor call (to allow forward decl)
        - Look into shared_ptr deleter
      - Create a vector-like container for tracking memory
        - Update all asset classes to use that rather than a vector
      - Changes to Tilemap
        - Convert layer to y-is-up (or document why it can be unique)
    Graphics:
      - Create a more cohesive way to represent sprites
        - Explictly define sprites from object sheet and normal sprites
        - Tie in with physics system (via entity).  Note: SpriteGroup/RigidBody
        - Logically separate position from depth - use vec2 when setting position
          - Remove m_far from TileBatch (really only applicable for bg layers)
      - TileLayer & SpriteLayer
        - ImGui support (rendering statistics)
      - Remove ISprite, Sprite, vops, etc.
        - Clean up SpriteBatch for above
      - Unify SpriteBatch and TileBatch interfaces



Assets:
  - Add bitmap font support
  - Remove SDL_ttf dependency

Graphics:
  - Add shader support for distance field fonts
  - Better support for texture based filter, blending & wrapping (look to LibGDX)
  - Add support for 24bpp images (surface and texture)
  - Remove glew dependency in favor of glLoadGen
  - Add viewport class
  - Shader hot reload
  - OpenGL context settings configuration variables

Graphics (low priority - implement as needed);
  - General
    - Add rich text support
    - Implement "focus" system for UI controls
    - Create a perspective camera
    - Ability to pad NPOT textures
    - Improve texture sorting (see HMH radix sort)
  - SpriteLayer
    - Add support SpriteRenderOrder
    - Global color (for tinting)
  - TileLayer
    - Add support TileRenderOrder
    - TileLayer Global color (for tinting)

Physics:
  - Change all for_each lambdas to use a range based for
  - Move GJK and all itersects methods out of the shapes and into collision.cpp
  - Solving:
    - Warm starting (seems to cut down processing time considerably)
    - Box2D "Box Solver" LCP (Linear complementarity problem)
    - TOI solver
  - Change GraphListener to lambdas.  Implement destruction listener.
  - RigidBody has a lot of unimplemented methods
  - Clean up and finish documenting
  - Stats
  - Add way to step at a set interval defined through the ctor
  - [maybe] More joint support

Math:

Util:
  - Enhance global memory tracker
    - Find an elegant way to categorize tracking.
      - Idea: Remove all memory_profile references, and rather than passing the pointer
        to the profile you just pass an enum.  Subsystems could be better tracked by creating
        a stateful system (e.g. PUSH_TRACKED_MEMORY_SUBSYSTEM(xxx_physics)).  The enums
        provided to the malloc call would be more specific, like xxx_freelist.
    - Improve ImGui memory tracking window.
    - Find solution for properly aligning memory.
    - Investigate overriding SDL allocation for tracking (like STB is overridden in surface.cpp)

  - Add proper logging across the library
  - Normalize and add support for normal print and pretty printing
  - Support TextInput and TextEdit SDL events

Debug:
  - Normalize a stat dump system across all applicable objects
    - Useful for outputting stats at run time and on command
    - Perhaps using metaprogramming to dynamically build display output
  - Add more debug rendering functionality
    - Labels placed on the upper left corner of a wireframe
    - Enhance physics rendering similar to Box2D
    - Add support for line widths (have to use quads w/ shader b/c lack of line width support)
    - Create debug settings for what to display.  Should be able to be reloaded at runtime.
  - Create event recording and playback

Game
  - Application ctor should take the path, as well as the settings
  - Anchoring system for entity placement

Misc
  - Remove internal
  - Support targeted builds
  - Verify delegating constructors across library
  - Init SDL on demand
  - Ensure Move semantics across library
  - Code conformity maintenence

Low Priority
  - Create scope guard
  - std::optional support
  - Clean up maths
  - Create Parallax layer
  - Support for custom config values (possibly with hot reload)
  - Create a better sqrt
