Working (enhancements)

    - Finish NinePatch
      - This includes importing the UI
    - Script refactor
      - Asset waterfall should have three steps:
        1) Aseprite export
          - Intermediate image export for Tiled
          - Slices/Animations preps for cooking
        2) Asset cooking (preps for packing)
        3) Asset packing
      - This includes:
        - Rename cooker/export*.py to cooker/cook*.py
        - Create scripts for Aseprite export
          - Scripts must 'touch' the master export file or the changes will be skipped
    - Animation refactor
      - Animations are currently hard-coded and should simply be an import from Aseprite
      - The json will be updated which requires changes to the spritesheet, scripts,
        and asset_packer.

    - Combine compiler.hpp and internal/hints.hpp

    - Test out whether the objects in a spritesheet need to have a positive position.
      It should not be a requirement that the shape be inside the sprite.
    - Refactor action_trigger_data
      - scene_id, action_id, action_type and even invoke_required shouldn't be
        populated from Tiled.  This may be fine for scene objects, but when the
        shape is a child of a tile object, you lose scalability.  What defines the
        action_trigger should be populated elsewhere.
    - When a trigger is invoked, either the actor or the scene should handle it.
        - Create IActor::Extract and add an OnActionTriggered(fixture_user_data)
    - Refactor ext_data
        - object_types should just be a global and treated as a first class asset.
          Since both Tilemaps and Tilesets utilize them it doesn't make sense to
          tie them to a Tilemap.
        - They should also be added to types.hpp.  Rather than calling all the
          Getter methods.

    - Move CREATE_TILE_LAYER to import.cpp
    - Formally define a TileObject?
      - Importing is tied to Tiled


    Util:
      - Update all asset classes to use simple_varray rather than a vector
      - Move all containers to adt
    Graphics:
      - Create a better way to sort sprites for rendering
        - This should include added z-index support.  See Handmade Reference Notes Ep 52
      - Create a more cohesive way to represent sprites
        - Explictly define sprites from object sheet and normal sprites
        - Tie in with physics system (via entity).  Note: SpriteGroup/RigidBody
        - Logically separate position from depth - use vec2 when setting position
          - Remove m_far from TileBatch (really only applicable for bg layers)


Game:
  - Some tile layers are rendered above sprite layers and are used for accessorizing
    static sprites.  This doesn't play well when rendering as they're always on top.
    Need to figure out a way to render the tiles along with the sprites they're tied to.
  - Define a global object id
    - This is to tie in different resources (e.g. The dialog system, animations, etc.)
  - Rather than creating a class for each NPC, I could create a generic actor which
    uses the global object id to load all data, and perhaps even behavior/attributes.

Assets:
  - Investigate removing shared_asset destrutor call (to allow forward decl)
    - Look into shared_ptr deleter
  - Changes to Tilemap
    - Convert layer to y-is-up (or document why it can be unique)

Graphics:
  - Animation
    - Rather than have all objects constantly playing animations, make changes to
      have define a base frame for each direction.  Then for animations (like idle
      blinking) I don't need to support multiple intervals.  Also, this would
      allow me to have multiple animations per state (e.g. idle_blink and idle_stretch).
    - Updates must be made to the json files
  - Add support for 24bpp images (surface and texture)
    - Probably better just to force load everything with 4 channels.
  - Remove glew dependency in favor of glLoadGen
  - Shader hot reload
  - OpenGL context settings configuration variables
  - Text rendering
    - Unicode support (wchar_t)
    - Rich Text / Markup support
    - GlyphLayout could have special functionality for monospaced fonts, like
      the ability to only change the uv coordinates rather than rebuild

Graphics (low priority - implement as needed);
  - General
    - Implement "focus" system for UI controls
    - Add viewport class
    - Create a perspective camera
    - Ability to pad NPOT textures
    - Improve texture sorting (see HMH radix sort)
  - SpriteLayer
    - Add support SpriteRenderOrder
    - Global color (for tinting)
  - TileLayer
    - Add support TileRenderOrder
    - TileLayer Global color (for tinting)

Physics:
  - Change all for_each lambdas to use a range based for
  - Move GJK and all itersects methods out of the shapes and into collision.cpp
  - Solving:
    - Warm starting (seems to cut down processing time considerably)
    - Box2D "Box Solver" LCP (Linear complementarity problem)
    - TOI solver
  - Change GraphListener to lambdas.  Implement destruction listener.
  - RigidBody has a lot of unimplemented methods
  - Clean up and finish documenting
  - Stats
  - Add way to step at a set interval defined through the ctor
  - [maybe] More joint support
  - Add support for:
    - RigidBody bullet flag

Math:

Util:
  - Enhance global memory tracker
    - Allow containers to use different memory buckets
    - Find solution for properly aligning memory.

  - Add proper logging across the library
  - Normalize and add support for normal print and pretty printing
  - Support TextInput and TextEdit SDL events

Debug:
  - Create ImGui "System" widget to display system information
    - Would include SDL and OpenGL info
    - Include a "Print to log" button
    - Allow all stats to be printed to the log at startup via app_setting config
  - Add more debug rendering functionality
    - Labels placed on the upper left corner of a wireframe
    - Enhance physics rendering similar to Box2D
    - Add support for line widths (have to use quads w/ shader b/c lack of line width support)
    - Create debug settings for what to display.  Should be able to be reloaded at runtime.
  - Create event recording and playback

Game
  - Application ctor should take the path, as well as the settings
  - Anchoring system for entity placement

Misc
  - Remove internal
  - Support targeted builds
  - Verify delegating constructors across library
  - Init SDL on demand
  - Ensure Move semantics across library
  - Code conformity maintenence

Low Priority

  - std::optional support
  - Clean up maths
  - Create Parallax layer
